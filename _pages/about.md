I'm doing my PhD in [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) 
& [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://eng.bigai.ai/), 
supervised by Professor [Zhaofeng He](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/hezhaofeng/en/index.htm) 
and researcher [Yipeng Kang](https://fringsoo.github.io/). 

I received my MSc degree with distinction in Data Science from the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) 
in 2023. It's a <a href="images/gla_winter_spring.jpg" class="image-popup">beautiful school</a> 
in Scotland that is said to have been the architectural inspiration for Harry Potter. 
My master's thesis research was on optimizing document expansion using reinforcement learning, 
supervised by Dr [Sean MacAvaney](https://macavaney.us/) and 
Professor [Craig Macdonald](https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~craigm/).
